	// Method : A method is a block of code or collection of statements written together to complete a specific task.

	//How to create a method in Java?
	
	//1. Identify the duplicate code in your programs that is going to complete a specific task.
	//2. Separate the duplicate code from each and every program and store it inside the block outside of the main method.
	//3. Provide a name to that block so that we can call it whenever we want to execute that block.
	//4. Add the method datatype based on the data that you are expecting by the end of executing those statements.
	//5. Call that method inside the main method to execute the statements stored inside that method.

	public static void main(String[] args) {
