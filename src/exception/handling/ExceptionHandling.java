	//Error vs Exception
	
	//Error: it's an issue that occurs during runtime, and it's not possible to handle it in the program. 
	//Example: OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError
	
	
	//Exception: it is an issue that occurs during the runtime, and it is possible to handle it within the program.
	//Example: IOException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
	
	// Exception Handling : handle the exceptions or control the exceptions.
	
	// Types of Exception Handling:
	
	//1. throws declaration : when we know the exception details before itself (compulsory checked exception)
	//2. try-catch exception handling mechanism : when we don't know the exception details before itself (optional checked exception)
	//3. throw an custom exception : when we want to create our own exception (user-defined exception)
