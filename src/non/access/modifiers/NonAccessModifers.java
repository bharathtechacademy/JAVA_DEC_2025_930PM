public class NonAccessModifers {
	
	//Non Access Modifiers : Non-access modifiers are set of keywords that we are going to use in Java to control the BEHAVIOUR of Java elements.
	
	// There are mainly six non-access modifiers in Java.
	
	// 1. static
	// 2. abstract
	// 3. final
	// 4. synchronized
	// 5. volatile
	// 6. transient
	
	// 1. static :
	// The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly. We can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes.
	// The static keyword belongs to the class than instance of the class.so, no need to create the object to access the static members.
	
	// 2. abstract :
	// Abstract keyword is used to declare a method without body. Whenever you want to provide high-level information without implementing the method, we are going to use abstract keywords.
	
	
	//3. final :
	// When a user don't want to allow modifications on top of Java elements, we are going to use the final non-access modifier.
	
	//Final data cannot be modified.
	//Final method cannot be overridden.
	//Final class cannot be inherited.
	
	//4. Synchronized :
	

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

	}
